# Road Hazard Server
This is a student project created in early 2023 as part of my academic studies. Please note that this project is no longer actively maintained and serves only as a showcase of my skills and capabilities at that time. This project is an HTTPS server that allows users to post and modify road hazards, and view them based on coordinates, danger type, and the poster's nickname.

# Project Overview

## The server implements the following key features:

* User Registration and Authentication: Users can create accounts and log in to access the road hazard reporting functionality. Hashing is used to store passwords.
* Road Hazard Posting: Authenticated users can post new road hazards by specifying the coordinates, type of danger, and their nickname.
* Road Hazard Modification: Users can edit the road hazards they have previously posted. This functionality allows for updating hazard information as the situation changes.
* Road Hazard Viewing: Users, both authenticated and unauthenticated, can view the reported road hazards.
* Search and Filtering: Users can search for specific road hazards based on location, time of posting, danger type and nickname.

# Technologies Used
* Java
* SQLite
